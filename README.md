# Homework 1

This is the template repository for Homework 1 for [BEE 6940, Climate Risk Analysis](https://viveks.me/climate-risk-analysis) at Cornell University, Spring 2023. The goal of this homework is to make sure that you are comfortable with writing and debugging Julia code.

**If you are registered in the class, DO NOT CLONE THIS REPOSITORY.** Instead, use the GitHub Classroom link from Ed Discussion to create your own repository.

## Learning Objectives

After completing Homework 1, you should be able to:
  * identify the source of common code errors;
  * apply basic strategies of code debugging;
  * interpret code snippets;
  * use your knowledge of Julia to fix code errors.
  * refactor code into functions to facilitate debugging and reuse.

## Repository Overview

The repository consists of the following files:
- `hw1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the homework assignment. Students should create code or Markdown blocks as necessary to answer questions. **This is the only file you should need to edit.**
- `Project.toml`: Julia environment files. These should just work, but feel free to add other packages as needed using the `Pkg` package manager. **This is the only other file that you might end up making changes to, though you should do this using `Pkg`, not directly.**
- `hw1.jl`: Source file for Jupyter notebook generation. You shouldn't need to or want to touch this; everything is in the `.ipynb` file.
- `LICENSE`: This material is licensed using the MIT license. You can ignore this for working on the problem set.
- `README.md`: This file. You shouldn't need to touch this.
- `.gitignore`: This tells `git` what files to ignore. You shouldn't need to touch this.
